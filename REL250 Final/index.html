                <h1>Peter (also known as Simon Peter)</h1>
                <p>Peter was the first disciple approached by Jesus, he was a fisherman, which is notably somewhat of a lowly career at the time. He and Andrew cast down their nets to become the Fishers of men. Peter is also known for cutting off the ear of the guards come to take Jesus for crucifixion, as well as walking with Christ on the sea of Galilee during a storm.</p>

                <h1>Andrew (Peter's brother)</h1>
                <p>Andrew was also a fisherman along with his brother Peter, and was approached by Jesus in the same instance; he is sometimes referred to as the "First Called" since he was initially a disciple of John the Baptist </p>

                <h1>James (the Greater)</h1>
                <p>James was also a fisherman, but was also supposedly the cousin of Jesus along with John (his mother was Mary's sister) he was known as James the greater, not because he was better in any way to the other James of the disciples, rather that he was taller and older</p>

                <h1>John</h1>
                <p>John was James' younger brother, and was also a fisherman. Jesus refers to him and James as the 'Sons of Thunder' because of how strong willed they were, since at some point they asked Jesus if He wanted them to call down fire upon a village of Samaritans who rejected Him.</p>

                <h1>Philip</h1>
                <p> Philip was another fisherman, he recognized Christ as he is and the first thing he did after being called upon by Jesus was invite his friend Nathanael to see the Lord. He was the one asked by Jesus what to do with the loaves of bread to feed the 5000, and responded"Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little"(John 6:7).</p>

                <h1>Bartholomew (also known as Nathanael)</h1>
                <p>Friend of Philip, Jesus claimed that he was an Isrealite without Guile (someone who isn't sly or cunning). Some accounts claimed he did missionary work in modern day India. Many sources say he was flayed, beheaded, and crucified after converting an Armenian king to Christianity.</p>

                <h1>Thomas (also known as Didymus)</h1>
                <p>Occasionally called 'Doubting Thomas' after initially doubting the ressurection of Christ and claiming "Except I shall see in his hands the aprint of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe." (John 20:25) Thomas is notably a quizzical man, always asking Jesus questions and although the New Testament doesn't include how he met Christ, he was a very loyal disciple.</p>

                <h1>Matthew (also known as Levi)</h1>
                <p>Matthew was a publican (tax collector) for the Roman Empire which many thought was odd that he would be called as a disciple since at the time Rome had just recently taken control of Jerusalem. In addition, tax collecting was a profession seen as vile, tax collectors were often synonymous sinners, often lying about how much was owed and pocketing the difference.</p>

                <h1>James (son of Alphaeus, also called James the Lesser)</h1>
                <p>James, son of Alpaeus was also lesser in the sense that he was less prominent in the New Testament, not much is known about James the lesser. Some confusion between the James's led to claims that he was Jesus' brother while others claim he was possibly a cousin or someone who significantly resembled Christ</p>

                <h1>Jude (also known as Judas, son of James, Thaddeus)</h1>
                <p>There is also much confusion between Jude and Judas Iscariot as well as Jude, Jesus' half brother. Jude is not very prominent in the New Testament. In fact, he is only quoted once in the New Testament in John 14:22 "Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?"</p>

                <h1>Simon the Zealot (also called Simon the Cananaean)</h1>
                <p>Simon is another more obscure apostle, only mentioned in the lists of apostles. Many debate whether he was known as 'Simon The Zealot' because of his religious zeal or whether it was a reference to him being a member of the Zealot political party which many think would've been to contrast with Matthew the tax collectors appointment as an apostle, since the Zealot party was staunchly against taxes.</p>

                <h1>Judas Iscariot</h1>
                <p>The most infamous apostle, Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver in the garden of gethsamane, identifying him with a kiss to the Romans. Judas spent his 30 silver to buy a field that he would die in "falling headlong, he aburst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out."(Acts 1:18) Judas was the treasurer for the twelve Apostles, which is very symbolic considering his downfall. After his death, Judas Iscariot was replaced with Matthias who was the only apostle not directly called as an apostle by Jesus</p>
